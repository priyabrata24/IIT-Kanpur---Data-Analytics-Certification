# Project-1: Real Estate Price Prediction
# Problem Statement: Price of a property is one of the most important decision criterion when people buy homes. Real state firms need to be consistent in their pricing in order to attract buyers . Having a predictive model for the same will be great tool to have , which in turn can also be used to tweak development of properties , putting more emphasis on qualities which increase the value of the property.
# Aim: To Build a machine learning predictive model and predict the accurate prices of the proterties.The evalution metric will be RMSE.
# Data: There exist two datasets, housing_train.csv and housing_test.csv . We will use data housing_train to build predictive model for response variable “Price”. Housing_test data contains all other factors except “Price” which we can use for testing purpose.
# Methodology: We will build a L - Linear Regression Model to predict the response variable “Price”
